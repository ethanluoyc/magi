# Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling (PETS)

## Overview
This directory includes an implementation of
PETS [1] in JAX.

This implementation tries to match the implementation in mbrl-lib.
Currently, only TSInf propagation is implemented, but extension to other
propagation method should be straightforward.
